However, the diff summary does not show the required generated image files being added under frontend/public/assets/generated, and it introduces Internet Identity/auth and backend actor scaffolding that were not requested for a static informational site.",

      "reason": "UI code references the expected image paths, but the diff summary does not include any added files under frontend/public/assets/generated, so the acceptance criteria about the images existing in the repo is not evidenced.",
